              2. How to Enter
            </h2>
            <p>
              Each participant receives a unique referral code upon joining the
              MubaXpress waitlist. A “successful referral” occurs when someone
              signs up using your unique referral code. Each verified referral
              counts as <strong>one (1) point</strong> toward your total.
